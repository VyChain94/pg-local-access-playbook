PostgreSQL &amp; pgAdmin Local User Access + Permission Management Playbook

# 🐘 PostgreSQL & pgAdmin Local User Access + Permission Management Playbook

**Role:** Prod App Support Engineer  
**System:** macOS  
**Database:** PostgreSQL 17 (Homebrew)  
**GUI:** pgAdmin 4  
**Root Cause:** User account access, authentication misconfiguration, and ownership ambiguity leading to startup issues, connection errors, and unclear database visibility between roles.

---

## 🧭 1. Symptom Overview

- `brew services` showed service startup failures.  
- `psql` returned `connection refused` errors.  
- `pgAdmin` defaulted to port `5433` causing connection failures.  
- After fixing authentication, database `staging` appeared for multiple users unexpectedly.

**Diagnoses:**

- `pg_hba.conf` had invalid text blocks causing PostgreSQL startup failure.  
- Port mismatch between server and pgAdmin configuration.  
- `staging` database was owned by `postgres` but visible to all users due to PostgreSQL cluster-wide database model.

## 🧰 2. Resolution Timeline

### 🐞 Phase 1 — Service Recovery & Authentication

1. Identified invalid connection type errors in `pg_hba.conf`.
   
2. Cleared template noise and applied minimal secure configuration:

   ```plaintext
   local   all             all                                     md5
   host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
   host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5
3. Restarted PostgreSQL successfully with:

   `brew services restart postgresql@17`
4. Verified interactive psql access and pgAdmin connection at 127.0.0.1:5432.

### 🔐 Phase 2 — User Account Password Management
1. Reset ivytigsjr user password via:

`ALTER ROLE ivytigsjr WITH PASSWORD 'NewStrongPassword';`
2. Confirmed login with:

`psql -U ivytigsjr -h 127.0.0.1 -d postgres`
3. Updated pgAdmin connection properties to correct port and credentials.

### 🏗 Phase 3 — Database Ownership & Access Control
1. Identified staging database owned by postgres.
2. Explained PostgreSQL cluster database visibility: all users see all databases they have privileges on.
3. Provided two resolution paths:
- Change Owner:
``ALTER DATABASE staging OWNER TO ivytigsjr;``
- Grant Privileges:
``GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE staging TO ivytigsjr;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE staging TO ivytigsjr;``
4. Verified permissions via `\l` and pgAdmin UI.

## 🧰 3. Post-Resolution Commands Cheat Sheet
- List Databases:
`\l`
- List Roles:
`\du`
- Switch Databases:
`\c staging`
- Create Database for Specific User:
`CREATE DATABASE mydb OWNER ivytigsjr;`
- Grant Access:
`GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb TO ivytigsjr;`
- Reset Password:
`ALTER ROLE ivytigsjr WITH PASSWORD 'NewStrongPassword';`
## 🧭 4. Best Practices for App Support Engineers
🧼 Keep pg_hba.conf minimal and clean. Remove example/template noise.

🔐 Use md5 or scram-sha-256 auth; avoid trust mode.

🧑🏽‍💻 Create non-superuser accounts for application access.

🏗 Separate database ownership and privileges for cleaner access control.

🛡 Backup working configs:

bash
Copy code
cp /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@17/pg_hba.conf ~/pg_hba.conf.backup
🧭 Always verify port settings in GUI tools like pgAdmin.

🧭 5. Troubleshooting Port Mismatch
Verify the actual port Postgres is running on:

bash
Copy code
lsof -i :5432
If pgAdmin attempts port 5433, correct the Connection > Port field in the server settings.

Default port: 5432.

🧭 6. Role, Database & Cluster Visibility Quick Reference
Concept	Scope	Notes
Role (User)	Cluster-wide	Can access any DB with privileges
Database	Cluster-wide	Owned by a role but visible to others if privileges exist
pg_hba.conf rules	Cluster-level access control	Determines how users authenticate

🧭 7. Future Enhancements / Production Considerations
✅ Enable scram-sha-256 for stronger password hashing:

conf
Copy code
password_encryption = scram-sha-256
🔐 Consider SSL/TLS (hostssl) for external connections.

🧭 Set up replication if scaling is needed in the future.

📦 Automate pg_hba.conf backups in deployment scripts.

🏁 Final Status
✅ PostgreSQL running cleanly with secure authentication.

✅ pgAdmin connections established for both postgres and ivytigsjr users.

✅ Database staging visible and controllable via proper ownership/privileges.

✅ Full command history documented for escalation & future incident response.
